Project for cs.cmu.edu/~gelernter

* Current version of live website (morning of 7/16/2013) is in current/index.html

* Target layout of changes (per discussion 7/15/2013) is target/index.html

* So I guess the old website was index.**htm** so I made a new one called index.**html**

The "images" folder is being earmarked for future images. The professor keeps all of her images in the same relative directory as her index.html files, and I want to at least shutter those images into a seperate folder.

<s>Feel free to edit index.html, that is the file we will be putting changes into.</s>
